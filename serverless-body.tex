% It is strongly recommended to use the package booktabs~\cite{Fear05}
% and follow its main principles of typography with respect to tables:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Never, ever use vertical rules.
% \item Never use double rules.
% \end{enumerate}
% It is also a good idea not to overuse horizontal rules.

\section{State of the art}

Although most evolutionary algorithms work in a synchronous way, with
generations proceeding one after the other and migration happening in
all islands at the same time, there have been many efforts from early
on to adapt them to dynamic, heterogeneous software architectures
\cite{Jini:FEA2000}.
